                This website entails my journey through tech and code.</p>

            <p>I'm a third year computer science undergraduate at Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology, GGSIPU. Currently, I'm based in New Delhi. I'm a Machine Learning enthusiast and have done internship in the same domain. I've also gained knowledge about the working of MVC framework using Node.js and worked on web development projects as well. I've acquired working knowledge of Github and can easily do remote work. I also have a competitive knowledge of python and can easily learn any MVC framework existing in python. I always look out for opportunities that push me out of comfort zone because I believe that true learning happens when you push yourself.</p>
